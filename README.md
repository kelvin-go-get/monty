# Project Title: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Description
This C project focuses on implementing and understanding the concepts of stacks and queues, specifically LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures. The project includes various functions to manipulate and operate on these structures.

## Technologies
- C programming language
- Compiler (e.g., gcc)

## Project Files
- `main.c`: Entry point for the program.
- `monty.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.
- `monty.c`: Implementation of core functionality related to stacks and queues.
- `stack_functions.c`: Functions related to stack operations.
- `queue_functions.c`: Functions related to queue operations.
- `monty_errors.c`: Error-handling functions.
- `monty_main.c`: Main function and program execution logic.

## Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
